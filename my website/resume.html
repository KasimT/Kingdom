      <h2 class="Section-title">About me</h2>
      <p class="Section-title"> I was always a nerd in my youth, so much so that when everyone would go out and hangout and have a riot I would spend my time playing video games and reading comics.
      I love evry minute of it but like all goods things I out grew it. I started high school and spend my time like all others social media, concert, etc. I found my love in computer around my junior year of high school
      I was watching a show called mr robot and i that made me fell in love with computer all over again. </p>
      <p class="Section-title"> Abdullah ibn Umar reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him said, “Every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The leader of people is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects. A man is the guardian of his family, and he is responsible for them. A woman is the guardian of her husband’s home and his children and she is responsible for them. The servant of a man is a guardian of the property of his master, and he is responsible for it. No doubt, every one of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock”. I was shocked, and then he said. “That everyone, even if doesn’t look like it, is Shepard with its own flock and not every one of them is going to be the same. Instead looking and judging others you should work on your flock and make sure it’s the best it can be." That was merely one of the million wisdoms he passes down to me, and I will never overlook that. Therefore, that was a personal story of responsibility for me that vary my perspective in life. To conclude I’m not perfect, I made mistake and I will make even more. There will be times I might obtain focus on one sheep and neglect the rest of the flock, I might want to give up or quit. I can’t promise you that I will strive with excellent grades or a high GPA, I can’t promise you that I’ll even graduated. I can though promise you that I’ll shepherd the hell out of my flock and make the best it can be. I managed this far, and there will be even more obstacles in my way, but I won’t enable them to judge who I am. I will commit even more mistakes, but I won’t let them be what I am. I might apparently fail but I will be damned if I don’t try.</p>
